# Snake

## About
A tribute to the Snake games provided for the TI84+ graphing calculator supporting no field boundaries, time independent blue tiles which enlarge the snake and time dependent green tiles which do not enlarge the snake.

This Snake game uses a correct timer for the game loop as explained in Andrew Davison's *Killer Game Programming in java*.

## Use
